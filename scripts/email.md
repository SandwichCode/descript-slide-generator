So, how do you become a master email marketer? Put simply, it's divided into three steps. One, build your list.  Two, maintain the health of that list.  Three, email the list with valuable content every time.

Let's start by building your list. When building your email list There's really one rule and one rule only and that's never buy or rent a list and actually there are more rules But let's just focus on that one for now buying or renting an email list can lead to low open rates bad brand appearance and even Hefty finds from privacy protection agencies. 

Why is it important that users opt in?  Well having users opt in means they want to hear from you it also keeps you compliant with the ever stricter anti-spam policies being implemented by governments as well as email services themselves. A Double opt-in is even more effective since it requires the user to open and click an automated email.
